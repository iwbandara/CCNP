Redundant Network Design:
=========================

=> The 5 Nines of availability

=> Which is 99.999 of availability

=> A downtime of approximately 5 minutes per year 


=> NIC Teaming is a common technique of grouping physical network adapters to improve performance and redundancy.

=> The major benefits that NIC teaming offers are better load balancing and increased fault tolerance.

=> Port Aggregation (EtherChannel)

=> Backup Types:

	1. Full Backup => Backs up all data.

	2. Differential Backup => Backs up changed data since last Full backup.

	3. Incremental Backup => Backs up changed data since the last Full, Differential or Incremental backup.
